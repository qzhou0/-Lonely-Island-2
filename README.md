L #00: But What Does the Data Say?

## Hypothesis
For an n*n matrix, worst case execution time of our search method is O(n)
## Background
Given a n*n matrix where the every row and every collumn is sorted from greatest
to least, we propose that our search algoritm will be able to execute in linear
time. This hypothesis is based on the fact that our algorithm starts on the top
right corner of the "sorted" two-dimensional array and navigates its way down to
the bottom left corner of the array based on the values encountered. Through
this methedology, the maximum number of steps needed to find an element of the
array would be 2n, thus allowing the algorithm to in theory, run in O(n) time.
